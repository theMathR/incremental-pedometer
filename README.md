# Incremental Podometer Software

This is the software that we'll use for the incremental podometer
We're using Circuit Python 9.X
Refer to the [hardware repo](https://github.com/Spectralo/IncrementalPodometerHardware) for more details on the hardware

## How to run it ?

- Use **debug.py** to run it on a computer
- Use the new script **upload.py** to upload the software to a sprig or an incremental podometer (You need to install rich to use it -> ``pip install rich``)
