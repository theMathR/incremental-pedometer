# Incremental Pedometer Software
This is the software that we're using for the Incremental Pedometer, using CircuitPython 9.X.
Refer to the [hardware repo](https://github.com/Spectralo/IncrementalPodometerHardware) for the hardware.  
  
Made by MathR and Spectralo for the [Trail](https://trail.hackclub.com) organised by [Hackclub](https://hackclub.com/)!

## How to run it ?
- Use **debug.py** to try the game part on a computer
- Use **upload.py** to upload the software to a Sprig or an Incremental Podometer (You need to install rich to use it -> ``pip install rich``)


### Disclaimer by MathR _and spectralo_
My code is very messy. _and i'll make it even more messy :)_
