# Incremental Podometer Software

This is the software that we'll use for the incremental podometer
We're using Circuit Python 9.X
Refer to the [hardware repo](https://github.com/Spectralo/IncrementalPodometerHardware) for more details on the hardware

## How to run it ?

- Use **debug.py** to run it on a computer
- Use **main_sprig.py** to run it on a sprig
- use **main.py** to run it on an _Incremental Podometer_ !!

(rename these files to code.py on your circuit python device to make it the startup file)

My code is very messy. _and i'll make it even more messy :)_
